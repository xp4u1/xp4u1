I'm a Cyber Security student and work at ZEISS, keeping digital systems safe. In my free time, I enjoy developing websites and apps. I also mentor at juFORUM, leading workshops for youth groups to share my passion for tech.

If you use my open source projects, consider **[supporting my work](https://github.com/sponsors/xp4u1)**. Thank you!</b><br/>

<br/><br/>

### My Commitment to (Tech) Education

I had to teach myself all my IT skills because I didn't have anyone to support me. Unfortunately, this is the case at many schools in Germany (and the world). I want to help young people who are interested in technology. That's why I'm juFORUM mentor.

I want **education to be free**. That's why I've published open source projects like [Discite](https://github.com/xp4u1/discite) that are free in Google Play and the Apple App Store.

My work as a mentor is voluntary and I have to cover the costs for the Apple Developer costs for Discite (€99 per year) myself. Therefore, I am happy about any support, such as GitHub Sponsors or through a purchase of one of my other apps on Google Play or in the App Store like [memoria](https://github.com/xp4u1/memoria).

<br />

As part of my role as a juFORUM mentor, I've led workshops focused on technology and software development. If you’d like me to conduct a workshop at your location, please find more information [here](https://www.juforum.de/mentoren/workshopangebot).

All of my workshop materials are open source, making them freely accessible for anyone to use and adapt.
